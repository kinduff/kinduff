A couple of years ago, I came up with this concept and have tried to keep it in mind at all times; I've introduced it to a few companies I've been involved with, and it's been well-received.

The idea for this practice was born when I developed [Googleflog](/2016/08/14/googleflog-the-parody-that-turned-great) on a Friday afternoon. Most of the projects I have under [projects and experiments](/projects) have started in a Friday afternoon.

The premise is simple:

> Use Fridays, either entirely or at least for a good couple of hours, to develop an idea, experiment, or proof of concept on any topic.

I have been amazed by the results that this practice can yield in various areas, as it fits well with the famous _"Don't push to production on Fridays"_ rule, and it's an excellent opportunity to diversify the week's work.

The idea of creating, innovating, experimenting, or just trying can promote a creative variable in your weekly work or the work your colleagues or employees do. We dedicate little time to creative freedom, and Startup Friday can give you that time you're looking for.

And you, have you set aside free time to create on a Friday?

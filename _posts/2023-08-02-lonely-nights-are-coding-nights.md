  An ode to lonely nights and coding nights.
---

In that balance where all feels just right, when the PC is kind, and posture's in sight,

Where keyboard and hand unite with the brain, as eyes meet the screen, thoughts coded as gain.

The mood feels so calm, the chair has your back, weather is gentle, sound settles intact,

With music or stillness, wind's soft embrace, the mind answers call, ready to race.

Yet soon comes the need - an itch, a request, for food or a break, a message no less,

You fall from the zone, longing to return, to find that sweet balance, once more to discern.

  A thought about getting pirated as a goal.
---

I'm a writer and sometimes a singer, but the content I produce is not for sale: it's free for all. I do not monetize because I believe in free content, and that I might help someone in a struggle or learning path.

But sometimes I think about creating content that could potentially be monetized. Then I think about how I should monetize that content. Through a paywall? A pro subscription? Ads?

Then I think about pirating content. I do it sometimes, I'm not going to lie. Perhaps a way to measure success in one's content behind a paywall is the effort people take to share and profit from this restricted content.

Maybe I wish to be pirated someday. Maybe I wish someone likes my content so much that they might search for it on a pirate website or community.

And maybe, just maybe, that's when I know I'm successful.

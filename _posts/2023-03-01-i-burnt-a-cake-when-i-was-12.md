When I was 12 I loved to cook with my mother. She has this awesome skill that took me a while to understand (around 15 years) and develop myself, that looked like improvisation around the kitchen, but at the same time, she was following a set of instructions.

I wanted to bake a cake; those kind of cakes that look so good in the box, and that you only need to add water, oil, and an egg, and put in the oven. Saw my mother and my sister do it a million times, how hard could it be?

There I was, with a mix of powder trying to figure out how to turn on the oven. My mother, that was keeping an eye on me, saw me struggling and came to help me.

Do you want to turn on the oven? — asked my mother.

I do, can you turn it on to 120°C? That's what the instructions say — I said with confidence.

She went ahead and turned it on. This kind of oven had to be turned on with a match in order to light up the gas. It scares me to turn these kind of ovens until today.

We put the mix inside the oven and it was ready to go. Now we just have to wait. Around 30 minutes or until done.

When she went out of the kitchen I had a brilliant idea: if the mix will cook in 30 minutes in 120°C, it will cook in 15 minutes at 240°C. Of course the cake burnt, and I received a talk from my mother telling me that cooking doesn't work that way, that it takes time.

This got me thinking a while ago. Sometimes we are in a rush that we think that productivity and coding fast will give us better results if we are able to produce faster. I'm talking about tools, processes, and the way we think about problems.

Is going fast better? Is rushing the way to write better software and lead a company? Or should we slow down, give it time, and have a well cooked cake instead?

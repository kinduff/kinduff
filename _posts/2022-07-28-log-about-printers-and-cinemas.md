| **kinduff**   | Are dot matrix printers the only kind of printers that are not an actual scam?                                                                                                      |
| **vdamewood** | kinduff: That's a pretty loaded question.                                                                                                                                           |
| **GeDaMo**    | kinduff: laser printers? Daisywheels?                                                                                                                                               |
| **Raziel**    | kinduff, ink tank ones aren't bad either                                                                                                                                            |
| **Raziel**    | thermal scams you on the paper so eh                                                                                                                                                |
| **GeDaMo**    | Pen plotters! :P                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **kinduff**   | i mean, all printers seem like a scam, specially ink tank ones                                                                                                                      |
| **kinduff**   | saw this reddit post about an hp printer that was blocked because it wasn't authenticated                                                                                           |
| **kinduff**   | thermal paper seems legit, and I like them, but a4 paper is expensive                                                                                                               |
| **GeDaMo**    | Maybe you could use a knitting machine as a printer :                                                                                                                               |
| **Raziel**    | use a CNC machine as a printer                                                                                                                                                      |
| **kinduff**   | lol                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **kinduff**   | what about lemon printers? lemon ink + heat = printed page                                                                                                                          |
| **kinduff**   | wondering why this is not a thing yet                                                                                                                                               |
| **vdamewood** | Hmm... I wonder if it's possible to make a 600 DPI printer without infringing on any active patents.                                                                                |
| **kinduff**   | vdamewood are there a lot of patents for printing?                                                                                                                                  |
| **GeDaMo**    | There are patents for everything :/                                                                                                                                                 |
| **vdamewood** | kinduff: Probably. Odds are there are several patents that apply to any given device you can buy these days.                                                                        |
| **kinduff**   | there should be a startup or something to "revolutionize printers"                                                                                                                  |
| **kinduff**   | i can already picture the video                                                                                                                                                     |
| **kinduff**   | "hi, im tom, and i love printing, but most printers are a scam"                                                                                                                     |
| **Raziel**    | I can already picture the kickstarter page                                                                                                                                          |
| **kinduff**   | "thats why we created iPrintStuff, the printer that is made by printers, for printers"                                                                                              |
| **Raziel**    | "hi, im tom, and i love pissing, but most printers can't use piss as ink"                                                                                                           |
| **vdamewood** | I wouldn't mind selling printers for a profit, and not caring about selling ink.                                                                                                    |
| **kinduff**   | isn't ink the profit making thing for printing companies?                                                                                                                           |
| **GeDaMo**    | Use 3D printers as 2D printers :                                                                                                                                                    |
| **kinduff**   | like cinemas, they profit from candy instead of tickets                                                                                                                             |
| **vdamewood** | kinduff: It is.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **GeDaMo**    | It is now, you can often but a whole printer for less than an ink refill                                                                                                            |
| **GeDaMo**    | s/but/buy/                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Raziel**    | here's an unpopular opinions: cinemas suck and I'd much rather use my living room                                                                                                   |
| **kinduff**   | not unpopular at all, i hate cinemas and people in cinemas                                                                                                                          |
| **GeDaMo**    | Is that unpopular? :P                                                                                                                                                               |
| **kinduff**   | i prefer smelling my own farts                                                                                                                                                      |
| *             | edgar-rft butts a whole printer                                                                                                                                                     |
| **GeDaMo**    | I think cinemas are only popular with film makers                                                                                                                                   |
| **Raziel**    | GeDaMo, I've seen lots of people lose their shit when someone says they don't like going to the cinema and would rather use their huge-ass TV in the comfort of their home          |
| **Raziel**    | maybe they feel attacked because their TVs aren't that nice? :v                                                                                                                     |
| **vdamewood** | I like how COVID showed that no one ggives a scheisse about cinemas.                                                                                                                |
| **Trashlord** | is it worth doing a whole bunch of type casting and shit like that in C#, just to use bytes and shorts instead of ints, because I don't really need the range of int?               |
| **GeDaMo**    | Trashlord: only if you have a lot of data and you're worried about it not fitting into memory                                                                                       |
| **Raziel**    | vdamewood, I wish they'd just keep releasing stuff on home media at the same time as cinemas, as they were doing during covid                                                       |
| **Trashlord** | also I prefer to see movies at home than at the cinema                                                                                                                              |
| **GeDaMo**    | Also performance, I guess                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Raziel**    | but every moviemaker would apparently lose their shit because their artistic vision can't be fulfilled on people's shitty home setups (read: they don't get the sweet cinema money) |
| **Trashlord** | GeDaMo: I have the memory, I just think that I should try to save as many resources as I can, because why not?                                                                      |
| **kinduff**   | long term wise, it's a better investment to have a nice home cinema setup instead of paying a suckass cinema everytime you want to watch a movie                                    |
| **Raziel**    | Trashlord, it probably isn't worth it, and also slower                                                                                                                              |
| **Raziel**    | unless you're short on memory                                                                                                                                                       |
| **GeDaMo**    | Using smaller data types saves on cache space but may be slower to process                                                                                                          |
| **Trashlord** | ah                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **vdamewood** | I just realized, that these days, a Bluray costs about the same as, at most, 4 cinema tickets.                                                                                      |
| **vdamewood** | Often, fewer than 4.                                                                                                                                                                |

  The impact of a unified team in customer interactions
---

Imagine you're on the hunt for a new sweater and decide to visit a local clothing store. Upon arrival, you engage with Tom, an enthusiastic new employee who began working there last week. You inquire about the sweater selection, and he's eager to help, providing prompt responses.

As this unfolds, Clarice, the store owner, approaches. With genuine concern, she inquires if everything is okay. You affirm that it is, expressing interest in a sweater that Tom has recommended.

There's a subtle change in her attitude as she questions Tom's recommendation. A mild debate ensues between them, revealing that Tom might lack proper training, but also highlighting Clarice’s own deficiencies in organization and communication skills.

Now, let’s reimagine this scenario. When Clarice joins in and realizes that Tom has provided some incorrect information, she smoothly rectifies the situation with grace. "I apologize for the oversight," she says. "Tom is one of our newest team members and he’s adapting well. Perhaps this alternative sweater might suit your tastes?"

This approach leaves you with a positive impression—instead of sensing tension, you observe Clarice's empathetic leadership, keeping the focus squarely on your needs.

When such moments are handled skillfully, it doesn’t go unnoticed. We all recognize when there’s a breakdown in organization and communication.

The same principle applies to meetings with clients or other businesses. Your team should present a unified front. By steering clear of public disputes, condescending corrections, or any semblance of disarray, you ensure that stakeholders concentrate on what truly matters, rather than getting distracted by your team dynamics.

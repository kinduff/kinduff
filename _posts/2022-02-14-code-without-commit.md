I can't say how many projects I've started that I haven't finished.

Maybe it's something related to software engineering because this situation is pretty common among us.

I haven't heard of a carpenter who has not finished a project. A chair without a backrest. A table without a leg.

Sometimes we focus on trivial things, like setting up a project or buying a domain.

The value of our ideas must rely on the execution, of the idea itself, of the project itself.

Maybe next time, I'll code without commit, without conventions, rules, or a plan. Without a plan of what to code, but to code an idea.

And maybe, just maybe, this time I'll be able to finish it.

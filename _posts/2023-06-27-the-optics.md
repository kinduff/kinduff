  The significance of questioning widely-held beliefs and how this can lead to new insights.
---

I don't remember when I was told this or perhaps stumbled upon it randomly on the internet: glasses are commonly made of plastic, specifically cellulose acetate.

My mind was blown when I first heard about this. I took my glasses off and confirmed that they were not, in fact, made of glass.

I recalled how most optical shops I've visited don't usually mention this unless you ask directly, and they often use other names to refer to the material itself.

It felt like I was experiencing my own Mandela effect. But then I started asking friends and family about it, and their reactions were priceless. Their minds were blown just as mine had been when I first discovered this information. Some of them even began telling others about it.

Why are glasses so expensive if they're made of plastic? Are optical stores scamming us and using different names just to be able to sell them at a higher price? Is plastic truly better than glass, but the price never dropped due to these tactics?

That's the thing with information we assume we know â€“ we don't usually question whether it's accurate. However, when we do question it, we can uncover new perspectives because, in the end, everything is about optics - pun intended.

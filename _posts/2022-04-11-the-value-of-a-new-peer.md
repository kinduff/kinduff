  New peers bring the missing objectivity that makes a team grow.

Whenever I have a new peer in my team or a team I usually collaborate with, I ask the same thing:

> Please don't hesitate to provide any feedback and questions regarding our way of work during your onboarding period.

The familiarity that teammates have in an ongoing project pollutes the objectivity of improvements and criticism regarding the way of work.

New peers look at things with fresh eyes and bring with them different ways of doing things and interacting with people.

The contrast between past practices and new practices in a company is gold because a new ink color is being dropped into the mix, making it glow with a different shade.

We lose objectivity with time, new peers allow us to question our methods, and that is what makes a team grow more successful.

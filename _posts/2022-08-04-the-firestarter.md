  A quality I try to have and look for at my jobs.
---

There is a quality in professionals that I really like and that sometimes I look for when I'm interviewing people for a job.

The quality is to focus the efforts of a managing position into being replaceable, but not in the sense of the job itself - although, it's good to make yourself replaceable - but more in a sense of delegating new work that already has shape.

A firestarter is able to start things, make them stable, take them from the beginning and shape them in a way that others can continue the work from what it was left from. When a firestarter starts something, it will be able to delegate it when it's ready to be delegated.

The firestarter will start the fire, it will be the spark that starts the heat, and when the flame is stable enough, someone else can continue making the fire grow bigger and better.

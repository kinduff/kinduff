  I've switched to using fun, temporary code names for projects instead of domain names
---

Only the [FSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster) knows how much money I've spent on domain names when I'm excited about an idea.

I must own around 10 domain names that I've parked, and every year I receive that pesky email from my registrar urging me to renew. That's when I consider whether I should renew for another year or just let them go.

It's always the same story. I come up with an idea that I want to develop. I think of an amazing name, and **oh my goodness, the .com is available!** Maybe I should buy it since I'm going to build it anyway. It’s only $10. Alright, let’s do it. Then it's time to start the project. I quickly set up the scaffolding, but then I hit a wall. I get distracted. I stop working on it. A year goes by, and I get reminded of it.

I’ve also realized that when I name the project or idea ahead of time, ==the idea becomes entangled with the name.== This doesn't make sense at this stage because **the name should adapt to the idea, not the other way around.**

Now, I've started using code names for my projects. Instead of jumping the gun, I use a generator until something feels right and fun. Examples include: **European Toad**, **Quick Whale**, **Long Giraffe**.

A couple of months ago, I named a project "Long Giraffe." Once I was satisfied with the product, I then started to think about its name.

This approach gave me so many ideas for the name since I was finally able to adapt it to the product. I was able to research, play with options, and I even thought of creating a [Recursive Acronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym), which I love. I asked around to see how it sounded.

In the end, I found a name and I am very happy with it. I managed to name the product I created by detaching the name from the idea at the beginning.

**Ideas change. They evolve.** Let them do their thing instead of chaining them to something that just sounds right.

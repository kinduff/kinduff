Proton is absolutely amazing. I've started buying a few more indy titles to play a little bit, and they tend to "just work" most of the time now (which definitely didn't used to be the case).

Even with a somewhat unusual system, and running wayland, the experience is fantastic. (NOTE: I also don't tend to buy triple A games on my computer, so that could obviously be an issue).

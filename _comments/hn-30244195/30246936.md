I'm fine with people praising Valve for utilising linux to advance their commercial interests. It's an example of a "win win" situation.

However I notice on these forums in particular when other tech companies do similar it isn't seen so charitably.

I speak with a slightly cynical tone because I've seen this story before - the catalyst to the changing public opinion has been less about what the companies actually do and more about when competitors emerge and engage PR campaigns to recast the incumbent as evil and the newcomer as a saviour.

One should keep their eyes open to see if the same happens to Valve.

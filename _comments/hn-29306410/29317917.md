I also log my debugging process, but usually I'm less verbose with the explanations and more verbose about the specific actions I'm taking. For example, instead of a note saying "starting a debugging session to find out the issue with the sign-up during a load test" I'll provide the full command I used. Why? So that the process is reproducible in the event that I need to walk back a few steps or hand off the debugging to another team. I'll also include environment information such as my current machine, PATH, and commit hash.

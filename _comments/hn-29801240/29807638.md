Does anyone have a solution to sync clipboards across:
1. The system (XServer)
2. A terminal text editor (Kakoune)
3. The same text editor on another system over ssh

I currently have 1 & 2 sync'd ok, but 3 is only one-way. I use the OSC 52 escape sequence (supported by my terminal) to sync a copy on 3 to 1. But I have not figured out how to sync from 1 to 3.

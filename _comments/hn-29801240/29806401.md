I stopped worrying about it when I installed the Ditto clipboard Manager[0]. It keeps everything, so don't have to keep track of what I copied in my short term memory. I offloaded that task to the computer. Turns out they're good at that kind of thing.

I wrote about it back in 2016 on my very ugly website: https://www.tidbitsfortechs.com/2016/02/clipboard-manager/

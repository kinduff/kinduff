I mostly freed myself from that weight with a clipboard manager. LaunchBar[0] on macOS and CopyQ[1] everywhere else. It’s nice to know I can Cut1/Cut2/Cut3, then Paste2/Paste1/Paste3 to my heart’s content with no worries of overwriting the contents of the clipboard forever.

It’s one capability I sometimes miss on my i(Pad)OS devices.

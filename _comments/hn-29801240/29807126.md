Nice little piece of writing - thanks for sharing.

One of the key things I can't go without now in my workflow is a clipboard manager.

I use Rofi (https://github.com/davatorium/rofi) in combination with Greenclip (https://github.com/erebe/greenclip) and it's a Godsend.

I have a custom keybinding (super key + c) that will bring up the Rofi menu to fuzzy search through previously copied items or pinned items. Super handy when writing code, finding old snippets, etc.

Can't recommend it enough.

It's rare to find people reifying these subtle subjective aspects of UI design so clearly.  Transience is a deep problem in UI design.  Everything from accidentally kicking out the cord and losing your (unsaved) work, to accidentally copying a selection and clobbering the previous contents of the clipboard (that you still also want to paste again too.)  Modal dialogs, modes in general, un-undoable changes of all kinds.  It's kind of like our UIs are video games in the sense that they are harder to use than they should be.  Video games have to have some sort of challenge or they get boring, eh?

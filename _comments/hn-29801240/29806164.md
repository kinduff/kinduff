Unify your vim clipboard with the system clipboard, they said.  The integration is wonderful, they said.

Well:

1/ copy URL from browser

2/ alt tab to vim notes

3/ delete old URL from notes

4/ paste new URL but get the old URL instead?!

How do I do the FORTH equivalent of swapping the two items on the top of the stack (and have a stack in the first place)?  :)

It looks to me like a bad architected solution...

If you have a background job to update data, there is no need to do any TTL.
If we're speaking about currency exchange, you might prefer to store a transactional history of exchanges, together with the current one, and populate a fast read model too (Redis) with a failover against the oltp version...

Maybe it's just me.

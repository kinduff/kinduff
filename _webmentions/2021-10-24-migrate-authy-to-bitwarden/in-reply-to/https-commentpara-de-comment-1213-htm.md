I was having issues where all the imported items had the same TOTP code but it was wrong. I then realised that although I could see all my accounts I wasn't logged in so they were encrypted. 


So for step 2 Open Authy, input your master password if required. I would say to ensure you select one of the items and ensure you are really logged in and your data is decrypted.

And damn Valve for not supporting a 64 bit Linux Steam client. Having to mess with installing 32bit OpenGL drivers just for Valve, sometimes messing up the installation left a bad taste.
At least give users the option to pick either 32bit or 64bit client. I’m sure many would happily drop 32bit games support for that. And people who want 32bit games pick the 32bit client.

“Please provide a 64-bit Steam package, so that those of us on 64-bit distros don’t have to install a gazillion 32-bit packages.”

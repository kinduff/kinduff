This is great but I still dislike that valve has no customer support whatsoever. They also offer no refunds for errors in their system. I’ve been in situations where I purchase something off the market and it says “could not find an item at that price” and purchases it anyway without updating the screen. This resulted in me having multiple of the same item and they wouldn’t even acknowledge the issue. I’m anti steam until they fix their huge customer service black hole. There’s no excuse.

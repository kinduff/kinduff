Let’s not forget Valve’s work on the AMD drivers; the Steam Linux Runtime (which makes it easier for game developers to make native Linux builds without having to use static linking); Flatpak security engineering for Proton (Soldier); Gamescope; and futex2, which they indirectly supported by funding Collabora. Valve has done more than just fund Wine and DXVK to make Windows games work on Linux—they’ve tried to actively improve the Linux platform as a whole, even funding KDE development.

With EAC and Battleye now supporting Proton, and Valve transcoding WMF games, we are feasibly going to have compatibility with 90% of the Steam catalogue by the end of this year. I don’t believe we’ll ever have 100% binary compatibility with Windows games, but the Steam Deck is already increasing native adoption, at least by indie developers. 

I await the day when Windows loses its monopoly on PC gaming.

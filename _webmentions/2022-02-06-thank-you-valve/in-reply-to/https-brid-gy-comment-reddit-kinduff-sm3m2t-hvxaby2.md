The work put into Linux gaming by Valve and countless others is the reason I recently switched from Windows. I settled on Garuda and am really impressed with the stability, ease of use and level of customisation - and lack of telemetry BS.

The game side still take a little bit of time keting at times, but a lot of the time it just works ootb.

I am not going back.

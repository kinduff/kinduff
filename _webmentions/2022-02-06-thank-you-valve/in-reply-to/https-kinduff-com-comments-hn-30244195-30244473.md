Claiming will be the year of the Linux desktop has become a running joke among me and my friends.
So I wouldn’t make such bold claims.
But other than that I am completely on board with what the author is saying. I come from the same background. Until just a couple years ago I had a Windows PC solely for gaming. Now I can’t remember when I last booted Windows on it.
Another weird side effect of this gaming revolution on Linux is that I prefer X11 over Wayland.
When Wayland became the default in Fedora I was on board, thinking it was the new cool thing. But gradually I realized that it’s really not ready for the big time. I still need X11 to share my desktop on MS Teams (thanks Microsoft for that btw), and I still need it for most games.

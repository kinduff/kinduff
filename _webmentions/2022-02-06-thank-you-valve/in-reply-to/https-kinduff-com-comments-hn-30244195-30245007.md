All well and good and I support Valve’s dedication as well. They are doing what everyone else is afraid of doing. Kudos!
One thing: stay the hell away from my kernel. I use Linux for the freedom it gives me. If you are going to install a rootkit just so I don’t aim-bot in your precious little game, the deal is off.
I’ll keep a close eye this year on how do you install Steam’s layer on Linux. sudo will not be ever involved! If I can’t install it just in my $HOME directory without kernel shenanigans then they’ll get a huge “Nope!” from me.

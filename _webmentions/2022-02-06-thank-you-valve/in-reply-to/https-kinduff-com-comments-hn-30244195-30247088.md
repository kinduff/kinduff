I’ll be happy when I can finally delete my Windows partition, which is used exclusively to play games.
I’ve already moved to Linux for a lot of stuff, because frankly, it just plays games better than Windows 10/11. For example, stepmania (a rhythm game) stutters like mad for me on Windows and I’ve never been able to figure out why - and the debugging process in Windows is akin to black magic. On Linux it just runs buttery smooth with 0 stutters. I can’t wait until more games are native ported to Linux and/or run well in Proton, and I can finally use a single, good OS for everything.

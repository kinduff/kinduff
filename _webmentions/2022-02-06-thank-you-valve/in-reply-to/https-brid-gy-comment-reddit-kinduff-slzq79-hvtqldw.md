For now (i'll explain), valve is our best friend.

The reason behind "for now" is simply because they are a corporation BUT they havent yet succumbed to the quarterly profits & stockholder madness and i hope they never do.

Gabe is probably our last hope as he could have easily made the stocks open to everyone and ruin the fun. But thankfully he hasnt and valve knows the slightly less profitable but better for the customer plan is nice. (I wish i was good with words, but alas, i cant explain myself)

So, thank you valve. For not becoming heartless profit seeking corporation #1337 and for the games.

(End here if you dont wish to hear my rant)

Sigh. Its really hard to explain myself. But the thing is; when corps. make it their aim to maximize profits and bring in investers, their soul dies. What i mean by this is: all the investors want is money. Nothing else. So they dont care about the customers nor the employees. The soul, the creativity, the passion, the self becomes not a fire that forges products of a soul but a mindless, selfless, worthless piece of thing.

It's hard to explain. And i'm not a native speaker so bear with me.

When someone works with passion, the fire inside them imbues that thing with a piece of themselves. That passion, cannot be caged, cannot be contained nor manipulated. This fire, this life energy, comes when a being does something with their soul. This is not something that can be called, it just happens automatically.

Thanks Valve, indeed.
But no, 2022 will also not be the year of the Linux desktop. I compare Wine with ductape. It works but don’t ask how. It’s fine for casual gamers, but these are few.
The year of the Linux desktop will only come when all the developers treat Linux as a native compilation target. When Linux has all the drivers. As long as games get “emulated” on Windows in Linux, people will always choose Windows.

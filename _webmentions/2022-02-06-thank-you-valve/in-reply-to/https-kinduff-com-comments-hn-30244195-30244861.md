I hope Valve brings something like they have done for Linux to macOS.
I opened Steam the other day, and by default it’s filtered to only show the games my system can play. I was curious how many games I’d lost to Apple dropping support for 32 bit, I’d never looked before. I can play 94 of my 345 Steam games.
My heart literally sunk when I saw this.

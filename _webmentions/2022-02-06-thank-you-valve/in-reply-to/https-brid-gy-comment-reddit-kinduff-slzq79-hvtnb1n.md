Steam Deck will be my first foray into Linux gaming. I was planning on just putting Windows on it, then opted for dual-booting it instead once I saw how many great features SteamOS comes with. Now, I think I might just attempt to abandon Windows conpletely. Every new feature announced for SteamOS makes it harder and harder to give it up for Windows.

Absolutely. I’ve been stubborn in the past five years or so about Linux gaming where if a game doesn’t work, I just don’t play it. And as time went on in the past few years, more and more games just… started working out of the box. Maybe 30% of games worked a few years back and now probably 98% work.
It’s not always perfect (looking at you, borderlands 3), but it works in a vast majority of games I’ve played. If gaming is a reason preventing others from stepping into Linux based on experiences from even two years ago, definitely check it out again – it’s night and day. It’s been incredible to see how quickly they’ve been able to make Linux completely viable for gaming.
Now about my productivity..

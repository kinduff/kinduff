It was my main reason for moving to Linux. It had been frustrating before, and even afterwards, but I had told myself that I didn't learn Window's ecosystem in a few days or months. All but 2 things in my house are now running Linux - a computer my son uses to run Roblox and a Xbox (they're both on a guest network, isolated from everything else). It was the best thing I have ever done. Its been a year and a half and I know Linux as well as I did Windows. I will never go back.

I cannot relate to the article. If I cut files and do nothing - they are not deleted from the origin. If I cut text - texts are versioned and backed up with git or similar alternative.
Even if I would lose something, it wouldnâ€™t take too much time to restore it. If its a password - 99% of them can be recovered

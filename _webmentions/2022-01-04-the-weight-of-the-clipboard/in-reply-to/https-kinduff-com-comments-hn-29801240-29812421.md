I have exactly this feeling and still paste somewhere or copy garbage to get rid of it though for macOS i use yippy as clipboard manager and it improved the feeling of being in control a lot.
similar ticks exist for undo history and saving as well as browser navigation. I wonder if this is something normal people experience or if it is connected to my strong adhd.

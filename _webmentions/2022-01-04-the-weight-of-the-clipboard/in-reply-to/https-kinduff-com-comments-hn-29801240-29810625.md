I developed a bad habit of not wanting anything in my clipboard after I’ve used it, so I usually copy the letter e (or something similarly unimportant). It’s almost like an OCD at this point (in the browser, CTRL + L, ‘e’, backspace, CTRL + A, CTRL + C, esc). One of my new-year’s resolutions is literally to stop doing this silliness.

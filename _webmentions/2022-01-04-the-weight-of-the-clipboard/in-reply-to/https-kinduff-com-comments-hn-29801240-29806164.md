Unify your vim clipboard with the system clipboard, they said. The integration is wonderful, they said.
Well:
1/ copy URL from browser
2/ alt tab to vim notes
3/ delete old URL from notes
4/ paste new URL but get the old URL instead?!
How do I do the FORTH equivalent of swapping the two items on the top of the stack (and have a stack in the first place)? :)
